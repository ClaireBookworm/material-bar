# material-bar
not material UI, but addison materials bar chart

*claire and chenault*

We used Addison Art Gallery data on their artworks.

After going thru the treasure trove of data, we extrapolated the material data, summed them up to find the top few materials used.

*surprisingly there were a substantial amount of baseball card artworks!*

Then, we found various materials around the makerspace and improvised to make a physical bar chart out of the data.

It turns out there were a lot of print projects of different types, like albumen, screenprint, or whatnot. We printed examples of those and just stuck them to a block of wood.
